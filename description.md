## Entry point

- main entry point is **main.py**
    - located in the root of the project
- it create an instance of `MainApp` which is the UI
    - located in the `ui` module as **main_app.py**
- in line 13 of `MainApp`, an `Analyzer` instance is created
    - `Analyzer` is located in the `analyzer` module as **analyzer.py**
    - it handle all the analysis tasks & feed results to the UI
    - it has 3 main functions to `clone()`, `analyze()` & `report()`

### Analyzer.clone() function

- uses **githubcloner.py** to clone all the repositories of a given user
- it also uses **repo_info.py** from `analyzer` module to get meta information about user (total commits etc)
- meta information is saved at `/outputs/meta.json` for later to analyze
- cloned repositories are stored at `/repos` folder
- if user runs clone() again, all the previous repos are removed before cloning.

### Analyzer.analyze() function

- `analyze()` uses **analyzer_utils.py** for utility functions
- runs the `PMD` static analysis and generates an inspection list at `/outputs/inspection_output.csv`

### Analyzer.report() function

- `report()` uses the `/outputs/inspection_output.csv` generated by the analyzer to generate a report
- it uses **counter.py, analyzer_utils.py** from `analyzer` module and also previously saved `/outputs/meta.json` to generate a text report, and feeds it to the UI.
